This is a C library that I developed a few years ago while I was learning data structures and algorithms. I did it to practise, and it was useful if I needed data structures for some small programs.

This library contains structures and functions for manipulating **binary trees**, **linked lists**, **doubly linked lists**, **stack** implemented with nodes and with an array, **buffer** and **circular buffer** with nodes and sequential circular buffer, and also **sequential queue**.

All the data info in nodes and arrays is kept with **void*** pointers, so you can keep any allocated structure or type in them, as long as you are careful with casting.
